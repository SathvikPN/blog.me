With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications

Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container(lightweight) 

Container contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host

getting the fix to the customer is as simple as pushing the updated image to the production environment.
