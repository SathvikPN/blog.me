Intuitive Framework put in explicitly.

1. Developing an approach to understanding the problem (break into units)
2. Get Right solution (go brute. get edge cases)
3. Design step-by-step Pseudocode solution
4. Analyse efficiency of Solution (Runtime and Memory complexity)
5. Looking out for Optimisation
6. Transform Psuedocode to correct code implementation.

Good. Practise Framework.

Programming == Problem solving applied to Software domain == meta skill

SWE Top priority qualification == Problem Solving (followed by language proficiency, debugging, system design)

"If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it." - Richard Feynman

Stuck at even sub-problem. It's fair and expectable. Try catching interest over irritation.

[Debug] [Re-assess approach] [Research google for sub-problems]

[Reminder]

- Each time you learn something

- Each time, you’ll develop strength, wisdom, and perspective.

Go for it.
